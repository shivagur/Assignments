    "Answer:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to make software development more organized and. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some simplified objectives of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️Modularity: OOP encourages breaking down a complex system into smaller, self-contained modules called objects. \n",
    "              Each object has its own set of properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods), making it easier to understand and work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️Reusability: OOP promotes code reusability, allowing developers to create objects that can be used in different parts of a program or in multiple programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️Encapsulation: OOP encapsulates data and methods within an object, hiding the internal details and providing a clear interface for interacting with the object. This improves code organization, enhances security, and prevents unintended modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️Inheritance: OOP facilitates inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and behaviors from other objects. This enables the creation of hierarchical relationships and promotes code reuse, as common functionalities can be defined in a base (parent) object and inherited by derived (child) objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️Maintainability: OOP aims to make software maintenance and updates easier. By organizing code into objects, it becomes simpler to identify and fix issues or make changes without affecting the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the primary goal of OOP is to simplify software development by providing a structured approach that promotes modularity, reusability, encapsulation, inheritance, and maintainability.\n"

    "Answer:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a class, attributes and methods are the two main components that define the structure and behavior of objects.\n",

    "➡️Attributes: Attributes are variables that hold data associated with a class or its instances (objects). They represent characteristics of the objects. \n",

    "☑️Instance Methods: Instance methods are defined within a class and can access and modify the instance attributes using the self keyword. They are typically used to perform operations specific to each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "☑️Class Methods: Class methods are defined with the @classmethod decorator and operate on class attributes. They can be used to perform operations that are common to all instances of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "☑️Static Methods: Static methods are defined with the @staticmethod decorator and do not have access to the instance or class attributes. They are independent of the class and are commonly used for utility functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes and methods work together to define the behavior and characteristics of objects created from a class. \n",
    "Attributes store the data associated with objects, while methods define the operations that can be performed on that data. \n",

    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python class methods, the self parameter is a conventional name used to refer to the instance of the class itself. It represents the instance on which the method is called and allows access to the instance's attributes and methods within the method definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self parameter serves the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing Instance Variables: By using self.variable_name, the instance variables can be accessed and modified within the class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Other Methods: self is used to call other methods defined within the same class. This enables the method to invoke other behaviors of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating and Modifying Instance Attributes: self is used to create or modify instance attributes within the method. It allows the method to store or update specific data associated with the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating Between Local and Instance Variables: The self parameter helps distinguish instance variables from local variables within the method. It clarifies that the intention is to work with the instance's attributes and not create new local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
