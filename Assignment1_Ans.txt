1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

*       -----------> expression

'hello' -----------> string

-87.8   -----------> floating number

-       -----------> expression

/       -----------> expression

    â€¢   -----------> expression
    
6       -----------> int number

2. What is the difference between string and variable?


String: A string is a bunch of characters put together, like words or sentences. It's like a message. 

Example : string = "Hello, World!"

Variable: A variable is like a container that holds different things. It can hold a string, a number, or other types of information.

For example:- my_variable = "Hello, World!"

In short, a string is the actual text or message, while a variable is a container that can hold different types of information, including strings.


========================================================================================================================================================================


3. Describe three different data types.?

Integer: An integer is a whole number without any decimal places.

example :  0, 1, -10, and 42 are integers.

String: A string is a sequence of characters, like words or sentences. It's used to represent textual information. 

example: "Hello, World!", "ineuronintelligence!"  "42"

Boolean: A boolean is a data type that represents either true or false. It's like a switch that can be on (true) or off (false). 
         Booleans are commonly used in programming for making decisions or checking conditions. 
         
example, True and False are booleans.

Also the other data types include lists ,  tuples and dictionaries  and sets...

List: A list is an ordered collection of items that can be changed. It uses square brackets ([]).

Tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of items that cannot be changed once created. It uses parentheses (()).

Dictionary: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. It uses curly braces ({}) or the dict() function.

Set: A set is an unordered collection of unique values. It is useful for removing duplicates and performing mathematical set operations.

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?



Expressions in Python used for the purpose of computing or evaluating a value. They can perform mathematical calculations, manipulate data, compare values, or call functions. 
Essentially, expressions are used to generate new values based on existing ones.


examples:

x = 5                   # Simple expression with a single value
y = x + 3               # Expression combining variables and an operator
z = len("hello")        # Expression calling the len() function
result = (x + y) * z    # Expression combining multiple variables, operators, and function call

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?


The statement spam = 10 is an assignment statement in Python. It assigns the value 10 to the variable spam.

In Python, assignment statements are used to assign values to variables. They do not produce a value themselves, unlike expressions which evaluate to a value.

For example lets now understand the kdifference  between an expression and an assignment statement:

x = 5           # Assignment statement: assigns the value 5 to the variable x
y = x + 3       # Expression: evaluates the sum of x and 3 and assigns the result to the variable y


From the above example  x = 5 is an assignment statement that assigns the value 5 to the variable x. 
On the other hand, x + 3 is an expression that evaluates to 8, and the result of this expression is assigned to the variable y.

So spam = 10 is a statement that performs the assignment of the value 10 to the variable spam .

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Ans:- 

the variable bacon still holds 22 itself because even though it is added with 1 but it is not assigned to any other variable to reflect the result .

So bacon = 22 is the answer.


====================================================================================================================================================================================

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3


Ans:-

'spam' + 'spamspam' === 'spamspamspam'


'spam' * 3 ===  'spamspamspam'

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Answer:-

Here are the reasons why "eggs" is a valid variable name while "100" is invalid:

Start with a letter or underscore: In Python, variable names must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). "eggs" starts with a letter, making it a valid variable name. On the other hand, "100" starts with a number, which violates this rule.

Consist of letters, numbers, or underscores: Variable names can contain letters, numbers, or underscores after the initial character. For example, "eggs2" and "eggs_2" are valid variable names because they consist of letters, numbers, and underscores. However, "100" consists solely of numbers, and therefore it is considered an invalid variable name.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

Answer:-

int(): The int() function is used to convert a value into an integer. It can be used with numeric values or strings that represent valid integers. If the value is a floating-point number, it will be truncated towards zero. 

Example:-

value = 10.5
integer_value = int(value)
print(integer_value)  # Output: 10

float(): The float() function is used to convert a value into a floating-point number. It can be used with numeric values or strings that represent valid floating-point numbers. 

 example:
 
 value = 10
float_value = float(value)
print(float_value)  # Output: 10.0

str(): The str() function is used to convert a value into a string. It can be used with any data type to obtain its string representation. 

example:

value = 10
string_value = str(value)
print(string_value)  # Output: "10"

====================================================================================================================================================================================

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'


Firstly when executing above statement getting we cannot concatenate int with strings error. So i had inserted 99 into "99" and then executed 

'I have eaten ' + "99" + ' burritos.'

output:- 'I have eaten 99 burritos.'
